For this weeks assignment, I was able to use a lot of what we did in class in my code. The  warmup was very easy and I had no problem with it. The planets problem also was not bad although it took a bit of time. I just had to make a method for each choice the user made and it was fine. The coin flips problem also wasn't bad as we have done something similar before. I was able to recycle the code from the last problem with some minor edits. The randomize problem was not bad as I just made a list in order of numbers from 0 to n and then randomized the order. Overall this assignment was not bad especially since we had extra time.
